     " 1. Use const and let instead of var, const is for values that never change, while let is for re-assignable ones. This avoids scope issues and makes code cleaner.",
     " 2. Arrow functions: Arrow functions ()=>{} are shorter and automatically bind this, making them great for callbacks and concise code.",
     " 3. Template literals: Instead of 'Hello ' + name, use `Hello ${name}`. It‚Äôs easier to read and supports multi-line strings.",
     " 4. Error handling with try...catch: Always wrap risky code in try...catch to prevent apps from crashing and to give meaningful error messages.",
     " 5. Strict comparison ===: Use === instead of == to avoid type conversion surprises. It ensures both value and type are the same."

The truth is, progress happens when you show up daily, even in small ways. Whether it‚Äôs studying, exercising, or building a new habit, the key is sticking with it. Perfection can overwhelm and stop you from moving forward, but consistency builds momentum. Over time, those small actions compound into big results. So don‚Äôt worry about being perfect‚Äîjust keep moving forward, one step at a time.",
